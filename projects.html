                I developed a web application written in Javascript and deployed through Firebase
                to display the battery level and charging status of a solar-powered lamp with a
                team of engineering students. I conducted user research before and during the
                design process and iterated through 30+ mock-up screens on Figma with new designs
                motivated by user feedback. Finally, I implemented the final drafts of the screens
                using React for the user interface.

                For SD Hacks in February 2021, my team developed a web application to assist
                students in solving math word problems and assess their proficiency in selected
                topics through a diagnostic exam. I created wireframes on Figma and we utilized
                a Wolfram Alpha API to provide a step-by-step solution to problems entered by
                the user and ReactJS, NodeJS, and Python to create the user interface based on
                my wireframes.
            </p>
            <aside>
                We won the Wolfram Alpha Prize for innovative implementation of the Wolfram Alpha API.

            <h2>Pocket Fridge</h2>
            <p>
                I developed a web application that helps users track information about grocery
                items in their refrigerator and the amount of food they wasted with a team of 
                fellow students. I designed sample screens and prototypes on Figma, created the
                user interface on React Native, then leveraged Expo to launch the web simulator
                and AWS Amplify and GraphQL for the database.
